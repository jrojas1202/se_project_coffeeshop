My personal website showcases my portfolio and highlights my skills and experiences. The website includes several sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact Me. The Skills section displays my proficiency in various programming languages and tolls. The Projects section features my recent projects and links to their GitHub repositories. The Contact Me section includes a form for users to send me a message directly from the website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :

In the future, I plan to improve the website by implementing a blog section where I can share my thoughts on the latest trends in web development and technology. Additionally, I would like to add a search functionality to the website so that users can easily find the content they are looking for. Finally, I would like to explore integrating the website with third-party APIs to add new features and functionality, such as integrating with LinkedIn to display my presfessional network or using a weather API to display the weather at the user's location.
